# Changelog

## 2026.4.10
- Refactor hook dispatch flow: move Python dispatch runners out of population classes into hooks executor helpers, and remove DiscreteGenerationPopulation internal _step_* helpers
- Unify hook execution policy when Numba is disabled: any registered hook type now uses one sequential Python dispatch path
- Rework SpatialPopulation hook aggregation to pin compiled hooks to owning demes and rebuild one consistent aggregate hook registry after set/remove operations
- Simplify spatial wrapper template to run migration-enabled spatial tick kernel directly; keep local lifecycle plus migration responsibilities explicit in kernel/docs


## 2026.4.9
- Correct carrying capacity (equilibrium metrics) handling in population builders
- Enhance sex chromosome handling and genotype compatibility in population dynamics
- Add support for heterogeneous kernel routing in SpatialPopulation
